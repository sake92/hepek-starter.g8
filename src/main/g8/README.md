This is a starter template for your Hepek Projects!  

### Getting started

Start up sbt console and type `hepek`.  
Voila, that's it! :)

You can also make sbt watch for file changes. Just type `~hepek` and you'll see changes in matter of a second.  

HTML/CSS or whatever you're rendering will be in `target/web/public/main/$package;format="packaged"$/site` folder.  
You can make an sbt task for copying these to a more desirable location.
